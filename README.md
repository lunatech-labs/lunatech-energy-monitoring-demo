# Energy Monitoring (in Manufacturing) Demo

This demo was put together for the North East Automotive Alliance's Energy Showcase event held at the Komatsu factory in Birtley, UK, in May 2023.

Originally designed to be something visual to have on our little table/booth at the event it turned out to require some changes, learning and custom development, and so became an interesting little project in its own right.

## This README is Work-in-Progress

This README doesn't cover everything that's needed to get the demo up and running (yet) - i'm working on that but in the meantime if you're interested in:
- Running applications (including Akka Cluster applications) on a Raspberry Pi cluster
- An Akka Projection for writing data to InfluxDB
- Using iOS RealityKit in general (and using it to render multiple instances of the same animated model in particular)
- Using Protobufs in Swift

Then contact trevor [spirally squirrel symbol] lunatech.co.uk for more info
